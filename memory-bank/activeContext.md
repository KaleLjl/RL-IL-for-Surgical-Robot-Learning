# Active Context

## 1. Current Focus
The `dvrk_gym/NeedleReach-v0` environment has now been successfully configured and debugged to be a 1:1 match of the original SurRoL implementation. The immediate focus is now to **validate this environment by training a baseline agent**. This will confirm that the environment is not only visually and physically correct, but also provides a solvable learning problem.

## 2. Next Immediate Actions
The validation plan remains the same, but is now unblocked:

1.  **Create Training Script**: Implement `scripts/train_reach.py` to train a Stable-Baselines3 agent.
2.  **Train Agent**: Use an appropriate algorithm (e.g., PPO or SAC) to train an agent on the `dvrk_gym/NeedleReach-v0` environment.
3.  **Evaluate Performance**: Monitor the training progress (e.g., success rate, episode reward) to ensure the agent is learning.
4.  **Save Model**: Save the trained model for later use and as a benchmark.
5.  **Document Results**: Update the memory bank with the training results and next steps.

## 3. Key Learnings & Decisions
-   **Environment Replication is Deceptive**: Replicating a PyBullet environment requires a meticulous, multi-layered approach. The process revealed several non-obvious pitfalls that are now documented in `systemPatterns.md` under "PyBullet Environment Configuration Patterns". This documentation is critical for efficiently configuring future tasks.
-   **Control is paramount**: Owning the entire environment stack, from simulation to the learning algorithm, gives us the control needed to debug effectively and build a stable platform. This decision was validated by the successful debugging of the `NeedleReach-v0` environment.
-   **SurRoL is a technical dead end**: The VNC experiment provided the final, conclusive evidence. The framework's reliance on a legacy graphics stack (TF 1.x, CUDA 10.0) is fundamentally incompatible with modern NVIDIA drivers, leading to unresolvable `EGL_BAD_CONFIG` errors. Further attempts to patch it are a poor use of time.
-   **PyBullet over Isaac Sim**: While Isaac Sim is powerful, its complexity and high barrier to entry make it unsuitable for our immediate goal of rapid prototyping and algorithm validation. PyBullet offers the best balance of performance, ease of use, and flexibility for this project.
