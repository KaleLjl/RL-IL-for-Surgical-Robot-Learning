# Active Context

## 1. Current Focus
With the low-level control issues now resolved, the primary focus is to validate the `NeedleReach-v0` environment by training a baseline agent using Imitation Learning (IL). This will be the first major milestone in applying AI to the custom-built environment.

## 2. Next Immediate Actions
The plan is to train and evaluate a Behavioral Cloning (BC) agent.

1.  **Generate Expert Data**: Use the now-functional `scripts/generate_expert_data.py` to create a dataset of expert trajectories.
2.  **Create IL Training Script**: Implement a new script, `scripts/train_bc.py`, which will:
    -   Load the expert dataset.
    -   Use the `imitation` library to configure and run a Behavioral Cloning trainer.
    -   Save the resulting trained policy model to the `models/` directory.
3.  **Create Evaluation Script**: Implement a new script, `scripts/evaluate_policy.py`, to:
    -   Load the trained policy from the `models/` directory.
    -   Run the policy in the environment for a set number of episodes.
    -   Render the agent's performance for visual inspection and calculate success metrics.
4.  **Document Results**: Update the memory bank with the outcomes of the IL training and evaluation phase.

## 3. Key Learnings & Decisions
-   **Environment Replication is Deceptive**: Replicating a PyBullet environment requires a meticulous, multi-layered approach. The process revealed several non-obvious pitfalls that are now documented in `systemPatterns.md` under "PyBullet Environment Configuration Patterns". This documentation is critical for efficiently configuring future tasks.
-   **Control is paramount**: Owning the entire environment stack, from simulation to the learning algorithm, gives us the control needed to debug effectively and build a stable platform. This decision was validated by the successful debugging of the `NeedleReach-v0` environment.
-   **SurRoL is a technical dead end**: The VNC experiment provided the final, conclusive evidence. The framework's reliance on a legacy graphics stack (TF 1.x, CUDA 10.0) is fundamentally incompatible with modern NVIDIA drivers, leading to unresolvable `EGL_BAD_CONFIG` errors. Further attempts to patch it are a poor use of time.
-   **PyBullet over Isaac Sim**: While Isaac Sim is powerful, its complexity and high barrier to entry make it unsuitable for our immediate goal of rapid prototyping and algorithm validation. PyBullet offers the best balance of performance, ease of use, and flexibility for this project.
