# Active Context

## 1. Current Focus
With the `dvrk_gym` package and `NeedleReach-v0` environment now implemented and tested, the project's focus shifts to **validating the environment by training a baseline agent**.

The immediate priority is to confirm that a standard RL algorithm can learn a successful policy in the new environment.

## 2. Next Immediate Actions
The validation plan is as follows:

1.  **Create Training Script**: Implement `scripts/train_reach.py` to train a Stable-Baselines3 agent.
2.  **Train Agent**: Use an appropriate algorithm (e.g., PPO or SAC) to train an agent on the `dvrk_gym/NeedleReach-v0` environment.
3.  **Evaluate Performance**: Monitor the training progress (e.g., success rate, episode reward) to ensure the agent is learning.
4.  **Save Model**: Save the trained model for later use and as a benchmark.
5.  **Document Results**: Update the memory bank with the training results and next steps.

## 3. Key Learnings & Decisions
-   **SurRoL is a technical dead end**: The VNC experiment provided the final, conclusive evidence. The framework's reliance on a legacy graphics stack (TF 1.x, CUDA 10.0) is fundamentally incompatible with modern NVIDIA drivers, leading to unresolvable `EGL_BAD_CONFIG` errors. Further attempts to patch it are a poor use of time.
-   **PyBullet over Isaac Sim**: While Isaac Sim is powerful, its complexity and high barrier to entry make it unsuitable for our immediate goal of rapid prototyping and algorithm validation. PyBullet offers the best balance of performance, ease of use, and flexibility for this project.
-   **Control is paramount**: Owning the entire environment stack, from simulation to the learning algorithm, gives us the control needed to debug effectively and build a stable platform.
