# Active Context

## 1. Current Focus: ML Validation & Next Steps
The primary focus is to build upon our recent success in training a Behavioral Cloning (BC) agent for the `NeedleReach-v0` environment. The previous blocker related to the `imitation` library has been **resolved**.

### The "imitation" Library Bug & The Solution
After a lengthy and systematic debugging process, we conclusively proved that the `imitation` library (v1.0.1) has a fundamental bug in its handling of `gymnasium.spaces.Dict` observation spaces. The library's internal validation logic incorrectly calculates the length of dictionary-based observations, leading to persistent `ValueError` exceptions.

The final, robust solution was to **circumvent the bug by flattening the `Dict` observations into a single `Box` (NumPy array) space at the data-loading stage**. This was implemented in the `train_bc.py` script. By feeding the `imitation.BC` trainer a simple, flat array bottlene, we avoided all of the library's problematic internal data processing logic and successfully trained the agent.

This entire debugging journey has been a critical learning experience and has been documented in `systemPatterns.md`.

## 2. Next Immediate Actions
With the BC training pipeline now functional, the project can move forward with its core ML objectives.

1.  **Evaluate the Trained BC Agent**: The first step is to systematically evaluate the performance of the newly trained `bc_needle_reach.zip` model. This involves writing a dedicated evaluation script that loads the model, runs it in the `NeedleReach-v0` environment for multiple episodes, and records key performance metrics (e.g., success rate, distance to goal).
2.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Based on the initial evaluation, we may need to tune the hyperparameters of the BC training process (e.g., learning rate, network architecture, number of epochs) to improve performance.
3.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Begin development of the RL training pipeline using Stable-Baselines3. The `train_rl.py` script can now be implemented to train an agent (e.g., using PPO or SAC) on the `NeedleReach-v0` task.
4.  **Compare BC vs. RL**: A key project goal is to compare the performance, sample efficiency, and robustness of agents trained with BC versus those trained with RL.

## 3. Key Learnings & Decisions
-   **Environment Replication is Deceptive**: Replicating a PyBullet environment requires a meticulous, multi-layered approach. The process revealed several non-obvious pitfalls that are now documented in `systemPatterns.md` under "PyBullet Environment Configuration Patterns". This documentation is critical for efficiently configuring future tasks.
-   **Control is paramount**: Owning the entire environment stack, from simulation to the learning algorithm, gives us the control needed to debug effectively and build a stable platform. This decision was validated by the successful debugging of the `NeedleReach-v0` environment.
-   **SurRoL is a technical dead end**: The VNC experiment provided the final, conclusive evidence. The framework's reliance on a legacy graphics stack (TF 1.x, CUDA 10.0) is fundamentally incompatible with modern NVIDIA drivers, leading to unresolvable `EGL_BAD_CONFIG` errors. Further attempts to patch it are a poor use of time.
-   **PyBullet over Isaac Sim**: While Isaac Sim is powerful, its complexity and high barrier to entry make it unsuitable for our immediate goal of rapid prototyping and algorithm validation. PyBullet offers the best balance of performance, ease of use, and flexibility for this project.
-   **Flattening Data is a Robust Fallback**: When a library has buggy or poorly documented support for complex data structures like `Dict` spaces, the most reliable solution is to preprocess the data into a simple, flat format (`Box` space) before passing it to the library. This circumvents internal bugs and is a valuable, pragmatic engineering pattern.
