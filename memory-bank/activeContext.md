# Active Context

## 1. Current Focus
The project has undergone a major strategic pivot. We have abandoned the problematic SurRoL framework and are now focused on **building a new, custom dVRK simulation environment from the ground up.**

The immediate priority is to establish a clean, stable, and modern development environment that will serve as the foundation for this new phase.

## 2. Next Immediate Actions
The development plan is set. The next concrete steps are:

1.  **Clean Project Directory**: Remove the now-obsolete `src/SurRoL` directory and other legacy configuration files to create a clean slate.
2.  **Create New Directory Structure**: Establish the new `dvrk_gym` directory which will house all custom environment code.
3.  **Implement New Docker Environment**:
    -   Finalize and implement the new `Dockerfile` that uses `nvidia/cudagl` as a base, installs a VNC-enabled desktop environment, and sets up the agreed-upon Python tech stack (`PyBullet`, `Gymnasium`, `SB3`, `imitation`).
    -   Create the `scripts/vnc_startup.sh` script.
    -   Update `docker-compose.yml` to support the new VNC setup.
4.  **Build and Verify**: Build the new Docker container and verify that a VNC connection to the desktop environment is successful.

## 3. Key Learnings & Decisions
-   **SurRoL is a technical dead end**: The VNC experiment provided the final, conclusive evidence. The framework's reliance on a legacy graphics stack (TF 1.x, CUDA 10.0) is fundamentally incompatible with modern NVIDIA drivers, leading to unresolvable `EGL_BAD_CONFIG` errors. Further attempts to patch it are a poor use of time.
-   **PyBullet over Isaac Sim**: While Isaac Sim is powerful, its complexity and high barrier to entry make it unsuitable for our immediate goal of rapid prototyping and algorithm validation. PyBullet offers the best balance of performance, ease of use, and flexibility for this project.
-   **Control is paramount**: Owning the entire environment stack, from simulation to the learning algorithm, gives us the control needed to debug effectively and build a stable platform.
