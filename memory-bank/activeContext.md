## 1. Current Focus: Diagnosing Critical PPO Bug
The project's primary focus has shifted to diagnosing a critical and paradoxical bug found in the pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent trained with PPO.

### The Problem: "Learning" with 0% Success
- **The Paradox**: The PPO agent, when trained, shows all the signs of successful learning in its TensorBoard metrics (e.g., rising rewards, decreasing loss, decreasing entropy). However, when the resulting model is evaluated in the environment, it achieves a **0% success rate**.
- **The Behavior**: Qualitative observation during evaluation revealed the root cause: the trained agent executes the **same repetitive action** regardless of the environment's state or the goal's position.
- **The Hypothesis**: The agent's policy has effectively ignored all observation inputs and degenerated into a constant function. This strongly suggests a fundamental issue in how the `MultiInputPolicy` is processing or utilizing the `Dict` observation space provided by our custom environment. The policy is "learning" to maximize a flawed reward signal in training, but this learned behavior is useless for actually solving the task.

## 2. Immediate Actions: Systematic Diagnosis
In accordance with our debugging philosophy, we will not make speculative changes. Instead, we will proceed with a systematic plan to prove our hypothesis.

1.  **Create a Minimal, Reproducible Example (MRE)**:
    -   **Goal**: To definitively prove that the trained policy ignores observation inputs.
    -   **Implementation**: A new diagnostic script (`scripts/diagnose_policy.py` or similar) will be created.
    -   **Process**:
        1.  Load the trained PPO model.
        2.  Create two different, handcrafted observation dictionaries where only the `desired_goal` is different.
        3.  Call `model.predict()` on both observations.
        4.  Compare the resulting actions.
    -   **Expected Outcome**: We predict the script will show that the predicted action is **identical** for both distinct observations, thus confirming the bug.

2.  **Analyze Environment & Policy Interaction**:
    -   **Goal**: If the MRE confirms the bug, we must investigate *why* the information is being ignored.
    -   **Next Steps**: This will involve a deep dive into the `NeedleReach-v0` environment's `_get_obs()` method and the Stable-Baselines3 `MultiInputPolicy` source code to understand how the `Dict` data is passed, processed, and fed into the neural network.

This structured diagnostic process is the highest priority.
