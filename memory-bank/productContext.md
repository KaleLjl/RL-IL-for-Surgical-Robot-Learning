Â·# Product Context: Advancing Surgical Robotics with AI

## Problem Statement

Traditional surgical robot control relies heavily on direct teleoperation or pre-programmed trajectories. While effective, these methods can be demanding for surgeons, especially for repetitive or highly precise tasks. There's a significant opportunity to introduce more autonomy and intelligence into surgical robotics to assist surgeons, reduce cognitive load, and potentially improve patient outcomes.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to investigate the application of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL), to teach surgical robots fundamental gestures. By enabling robots to learn from demonstrations and refine their skills through practice in a simulated environment, we can explore pathways to more intuitive and efficient human-robot collaboration in surgery.

## Target User & Benefit

*   **Primary User**: Robotics researchers and surgeons interested in the automation of surgical tasks.
*   **Benefit**:
    *   Demonstrate the feasibility of using RL/IL for complex surgical robot manipulation.
    *   Provide a foundational framework for developing semi-autonomous surgical assistants.
    *   Potentially reduce surgeon fatigue and improve the consistency of surgical sub-tasks.

## User Experience Goals

*   The learned policies should exhibit smooth, precise, and safe movements in the simulated environment.
*   The system should be robust enough to handle minor variations in task setup (e.g., slight changes in target object position).
*   The learning process should be efficient, leveraging expert demonstrations effectively.
