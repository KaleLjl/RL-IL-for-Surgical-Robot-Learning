## Brief overview
This document outlines the standard directory structure for saving logs and models generated by the training scripts in this project. Adhering to this convention ensures that experiments are organized, reproducible, and easy to locate.

## Core Philosophy
1.  **`logs/` is for transient data**: This directory tracks the *process* of training. It contains TensorBoard logs for visualization and checkpoints for resuming training. It can be deleted after an experiment is complete without losing the final result.
2.  **`models/` is for permanent results**: This directory is the "hall of fame". It should only contain the final, best-performing models from an experiment, typically selected and placed here manually after evaluation.

## Directory Structure Rules

### 1. Experiment & Run Structure (for RL)
For complex, multi-session training like Reinforcement Learning (`train_rl.py`), a nested structure is used to isolate each training run.

- **Experiment Directory**: Each experiment gets a unique, timestamped directory inside `logs/`.
  - **Path**: `logs/{algorithm}_{task}_{timestamp}/`
  - **Example**: `logs/ppo_needle_reach_1750928921/`

- **Run Directory**: Inside an experiment, each time `model.learn()` is called, it constitutes a "run" and gets its own subdirectory.
  - **Path**: `logs/{experiment_name}/run_{run_id}/`
  - **Example**: `logs/ppo_needle_reach_1750928921/run_1/`

- **Checkpoints**: Intermediate models saved during a run are stored in a `checkpoints` subfolder. These are used for resuming training or finding the best-performing model.
  - **Path**: `.../run_{run_id}/checkpoints/`
  - **Example**: `.../run_1/checkpoints/rl_model_80000_steps.zip`

- **TensorBoard Logs**: The logs for visualization are kept in their own subfolder to keep the run directory clean.
  - **Path**: `.../run_{run_id}/tensorboard_logs/`

### 2. Final Model Storage
- **Trained Models**: The single, best-performing model from an entire experiment MUST be saved in the root `models/` folder.
  - **Trigger**: This is usually a manual step after evaluating all checkpoints from an experiment. The training script saves the *last* model here as a default.
  - **Example Naming Convention**: The model filename should match the experiment name for easy association.
    - `models/ppo_needle_reach_1750928921.zip`

### 3. Simplified Structure (for BC/DAPG)
For simpler, single-run training scripts like `train_bc.py`, the structure is flattened as they don't typically involve resumption:
- **Logs**: `logs/{algorithm}_{task}_{timestamp}/` (contains all TensorBoard files).
- **Final Model**: `models/{algorithm}_{task}_{timestamp}.zip`.
