# Behavioral Cloning (BC) Model Evaluation Results

## Task
- **Environment**: `NeedleReach-v0`

## Model
- **Model Path**: `models/bc_needle_reach.zip`
- **Training Method**: Behavioral Cloning (BC)

## Evaluation Parameters
- **Number of Episodes**: 100
- **Evaluation Script**: `scripts/evaluate_bc.py`

## Performance Metrics
- **Success Rate**: **94.00%**
- **Successful Episodes**: 94 / 100
- **Average Reward**: -14.69

## Summary
The trained Behavioral Cloning agent demonstrates a high level of proficiency in the `NeedleReach-v0` task. A 94% success rate over 100 episodes indicates that the model has effectively learned the desired behavior from the expert demonstrations.

This result serves as a strong baseline for future work, including hyperparameter tuning and comparison against Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents.
